# git-changes-report
This script generates an HTML report of changes in a Git repository's directories, filtered by a specified file extension and a specified number of months. The report provides a hierarchical view of the directories with color-coded indicators showing the frequency of changes, making it easier to identify heavily modified areas of the codebase.
